To build this you need to locate it in a folder also containing the <a href="https://github.com/jupahe64/GL_EditorFramework">GL_EditorFramework</a><br/>
The folder layout should look like this:<br/>
<br/>
SpotlightProject<br/>
    -GL_EditorFramework<br/>
    -Spotlight<br/>
(make sure to get rid of the -master in the end when downloading both)<br/>
After that it should be ready to go.
