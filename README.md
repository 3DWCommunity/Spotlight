To build this you need to locate it in a folder also containing the <a href="https://github.com/jupahe64/GL_EditorFramework">GL_EditorFramework</a>
The folder layout should look like this:

SpotlightProject
    -GL_EditorFramework
    -Spotlight
(make sure to get rid of the -master in the end when downloading both)
After that it should be ready to go.
